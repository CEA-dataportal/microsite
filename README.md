**Community Trust Index**

The Community Trust Index, an evidence-based tool designed to measure and cultivate trust between humanitarian organizations and the communities they serve, owes its success to the collaboration and dedication of National Societies.

Initiated in 2022, the Community Trust Index is spearheaded by the CEA team, working hand in hand with National Societies from each country. The ownership and implementation of the national survey and its results lie squarely with the National Societies themselves. The development of the Community Trust Index, primarily focused on assessing community trust towards Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies, was made possible through cognitive research on Trust in Argentina, Azerbaijan, and Argentina. Special thanks are extended to the National Societies for their participation in the design and pilot phases, which were instrumental in refining the toolâ€™s effectiveness. The pilots were conducted in Zambia and Argentina, marking crucial steps towards enhancing our understanding of community trust dynamics and improving humanitarian response strategies.
