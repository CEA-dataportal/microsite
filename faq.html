                    <p class="pe-5">A group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society. Not everyone in the community is the same and within and across communities there will be a wide range of needs, capacities, and risks. Therefore, when you see the word ‘community’ in this guide, it refers to all the diverse groups who make up a community, including women, men, boys, and girls, older persons, people with disabilities, different ethnic groups, sexual and gender minorities and marginalized or at-risk groups.</p>

                    <p class="pe-5">Is “a person’s belief that another person or institution will act consistently with their expectations of positive behaviour”. Trust is driven by a solid social contract, which are rules, obligations, norms that bind the different people together and shape their thoughts, attitudes, and behaviours.  </p>

                    <p class="pe-5">In the RCRC context, the issue of trust was highlighted in a special session at the 2019 RCRC International Conference, where one of the key messages was that trust if often taken for granted, and as RCRC organisations we believe that communities trust us, but there is no clear scientific evidence on trust and what aspects we need to improve to achieve the quality and sustainability of our actions. Based on these recommendations, the IFRC's CEA unit is creating the Community Trust Index as part of the USAID-BHA project to help understand community trust.  </p>

                    <p class="pe-5">A scientifically tested tool(s) for measuring and fostering community trust in the humanitarian action. The tools include implementation guide, a quantitative survey with standardised set of questions that together measure the level of community trust toward a humanitarian aid organisation such as a Red Cross/Red Crescent Society, a qualitative guide to be adapted to complement the survey results, and more guidelines to move from data to action and foster trust in the National Society level.  The Trust Index is not a single tool. It is is an initiative that uses a set of tools (the survey is just one tool) to measure trust and grasp the contextual barriers and enablers of trust.

                    <h5 class="question mb-3">How was the Community Trust Index’s questionnaire developed? </h6>
                    <p class="pe-5">The questions have been pre-tested via cognitive interviewing to ensure cross-cultural relevance. The questions are then piloted in 5 to 7 RCRC National. Instead of asking a single question on how much one trusts the organisation (i.e., generalised trust measure), which is highly subjective, a multidimensional measure of trust allows the testing of reliability and consistency of the measure. The IFRC Community Trust Index is conceptualised on two dimensions: trust in the organisation’s competency and trust in the organisation’s values (e.g., fairness, transparency, accountability, neutrality, etc.). Trust questions are prone to acquiescence bias, which is the tendency for survey respondents to agree with research statements. It is anticipated that a vast majority of the respondents will say yes that bias the results. The rating scale used for this measurement, i.e., yes completely, mostly yes, not very much, not at all, and don’t know, is an extension of yes/no that is easy to use and will lead to more variation in responses.</p>

                    <h5 class="question mb-3">Who is the target population in the design phase? </h6>
                    <p class="pe-5">
                     The Community Trust Index is designed to be administered to the general population or any community member who has heard of the organisation. This includes the vulnerable population that a humanitarian organisation serves, community leaders and influencers who play pivotal roles in aid/support planning and distribution, as well as any community members who may become donors and volunteers of the organisation. Trust affects many aspects of a humanitarian aid organisation’s operation and therefore a general tool that can be used to measure the trust level of anyone is more useful. 
                    <br>
                    More questions can be asked when surveying the population who have received aid and support from the organisation because they have more experience and knowledge about the organisation. However, this population is also heavily surveyed for needs assessment, background documentation, program evaluation, etc. There should be behavioural data, specifically behaviours that exhibit trust towards the organisation, collected during these exchanges. Previous behaviours are powerful predictors of future behaviours. As mentioned in #1, trust is an expectation that leads to cooperation in uncertain circumstances, such as when people are not sure how to respond in a new situation. Trust is most salient when there is no previous history of exchange, and therefore the Community Trust Index measurement is developed for the population beyond those who already have a relationship with the organisation.

                    <h5 class="question mb-3">Why don’t use a third party to collect the data in the design phase? </h6>
                    <p class="pe-5">
                        Using a third-party data collection agency instead of the organisation’s own staff or volunteers may reduce social desirability bias and obtain more honest responses to questions about trust. However, it will require more financial resources to scale up the data collection. The pilot data will be collected by the NS staff and volunteers and the process is an opportunity to build their capacities of NS personnel on operational research to inform strategic planning and programming.

                    <p class="pe-5">
                    Because the questions are based on the operational context of NS and IFRC values, some questions may not be relevant to other humanitarian organisations. After IFRC has pilot-tested the tool and demonstrated its reliability and consistency, other organisations may customise and test the tool in their context.
