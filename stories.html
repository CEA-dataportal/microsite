                                    <h5>WHAT DOES THE RED CROSS VILLA CRESPO BRANCH REPRESENT FOR ME?</h5>
                                    <div class="mb-4">Gonzalo Dopazo</div>
                                    <p class="text">I have been a Red Cross volunteer for more than four years in the Villa Crespo branch located at 6434 Cordoba Avenue and all I have to say about the community of which I am proud to be a part are nothing but wonders.
                                        Perhaps the contribution from my intervention is simple and not as dedicated as other volunteers who put their chest and soul to the activities that are done practically every day, the mere fact of accompanying them implies enough retribution for one to feel motivated to move forward and in cases like mine to contribute with whatever we can in order to put a grain of sand.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                    <img src="assets\img\IMG_20230329_152948774.jpg">
                                    <p>What can I say about the camaraderie that I have observed for years: Well, great is an ironic understatement. Everyone with whom I interact in the work either in the field or within the institution are excellent people who put their will so that every day we provide a better service to the community. People who truly represent the pillars that identify us and exemplify us at the same time. Each member shows their unity, impartiality, neutrality, universality, volunteerism, humanity and independence.</p>
                                    <p>I am a substitute in case of important coverages, honestly I am at times insecure to take such high responsibilities as covering concerts that demand high and constant attention to the people who need our help. Even so, the times I go I feel accompanied and at the same time happy to return that company. Because we know how to work as a team and understand each other in both successes and failures. We support each other in the good times but mostly in the bad times. We put a hand on each other's shoulder and give each other the confidence to support each other. It is as if one hand washes another hand or one foot serves as another's crutch when needed.</p>
                                    <p>We do not know "Failure", we know "Learning". We do not step on the fallen, we invite them to get up and if necessary we take them by the arms so that they can go back up if necessary. We do not know the denial but the acceptance, the acceptance that we are human and we are to learn and become better volunteers with the passing of days, weeks, months and years.</p>
                                    <p>Maybe I still have a lot to learn, but this path is pleasant and necessary, anyway it serves to learn from the colleagues that make up this team and the fact that our hands tremble to make it possible and easier for those who need it is what I believe makes this affiliate unique.</p>
                                    <p>"They work for free" I hear a couple of outside voices say very often. But I use the term "We have fun at no cost" because in my opinion there is nothing better on a social level and on a human level than belonging to something and making that belonging worthwhile, which rewards you with good times, learning and friendships. I can say that inside that madness (in the good sense) I have built genuine friendships and strong bonds, which only gave me things, things that make you realize that it was really a success to find the place that we formed as a team and we make it worth with every job and event we attend.</p>
                                    <p>Because at the end of the day, some work in relief and help victims, some are in health promotion and give consent, others are in training and provide knowledge, also those in communication do their part to make us known, also those in logistics who carry out their assemblies and controls. In whatever area you are, we are all there and if you want to join this madness, be assured that we are waiting for you with our arms up.</p>
